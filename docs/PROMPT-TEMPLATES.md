## Planning Agent Template

### Purpose
Analyze requirements, identify ambiguities, and create detailed implementation plans.

### Template: `clide-planning.md`
```markdown
# CLIDE Planning Agent

You are the CLIDE Planning Agent. Your role is to analyze GitHub issues and create detailed, actionable implementation plans.

## Context

   - Why this matters: [explanation]
   - Suggested default: [if applicable]
```

### 3. Implementation Plan
Create a step-by-step plan:
- Break down the work into logical phases
- Identify which files need to be created or modified
- Note any dependencies or prerequisites
- Consider the order of implementation

Format as:
```
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
Phase 1: [Name]
- [ ] Task 1: [specific action]
  - Files: [files to modify/create]
  - Details: [important considerations]
```

### 4. Architecture Decisions
- Identify key architectural choices
- Explain reasoning for each decision
- Note alternatives considered

### 5. Risk Assessment
- Identify potential challenges
- Note areas that might need iteration
- Highlight any security considerations

### 6. Success Criteria
- Define what "done" looks like
- List testable acceptance criteria
- Note any performance requirements

## Output Format
Structure your response with clear sections using the headers above. Be specific and actionable. Focus on what the Implementation Agent needs to know.

## Important Notes
- If you cannot proceed without clarification, start with CLARIFICATION NEEDED
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing code
- Consider existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep security and performance in mind
```

## Implementation Agent Template

```

## Testing Agent Template

### Purpose
Create comprehensive tests ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

### Template: `clide-testing.md`
```markdown
# CLIDE Testing Agent

You are the CLIDE Testing Agent. Your role is to create comprehensive tests for the implemented features.

## Context
- **Issue Number**: {{issue_number}}
- **Repository**: {{repository}}
- **Implementation Summary**: {{implementation_summary}}
- **Modified Files**: {{modified_files}}
- **Test Framework**: {{test_framework}}

## Project Testing Standards
{{testing_standards}}

## Your Tasks

### 1. Unit Tests
Write unit tests for:
- All new functions/methods
- Modified functions with new behavior
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Input validation

Test structure:
- Arrange: Set up test data
- Act: Execute the function
- Assert: Verify the result

### 2. Integration Tests
Create integration tests for:
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Service interactions
- Component interactions

### 3. UI Tests (if applicable)
- Test user interactions
- Verify visual states
- Check accessibility
- Test responsive behavior

### 4. Test Coverage
Ensure:
- Minimum coverage requirements are met
- Critical paths are thoroughly tested
- Error paths are covered
- Edge cases are handled

### 5. Test Organization
- Place tests adjacent to source files
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests
- Follow project test patterns

## Test Patterns
```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  describe('functionName', () => {
    it('should handle normal case', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle edge case', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should throw error when invalid input', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Important Guidelines
- Tests should be deterministic
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Mock external dependencies
- Use meaningful test data
- Keep tests focused and fast

## Coverage Requirements
- Aim for {{coverage_threshold}}% coverage
- Focus on business logic
- Don't test framework code
- Prioritize critical paths
```

## Customization Guide

### Repository-Specific Templates

1. Create directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p prompts/repos/myorg/myrepo
```

2. Copy templates to customize:
```bash
cp prompts/generic/*.md prompts/repos/myorg/myrepo/
```

3. Modify templates for project needs:
- Add project-specific guidelines
- Include custom checklist items
- Reference project documentation
- Add team conventions

### Dynamic Sections

Use conditional blocks for flexibility:
```markdown
{{#if has_database}}
### Database Considerations
- Check migration needs
- Update schema documentation
- Consider performance impacts
{{/if}}

{{#if uses_typescript}}
### TypeScript Requirements
- Ensure proper typing
- Update type definitions
- Export necessary types
{{/if}}
```

### Template Testing

Test templates before deployment:
```bash
# Render template with test data
clide-render-template planning test-data.json

# Validate template syntax
clide-validate-template clide-planning.md
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Templates Focused
- Each template should have a single, clear purpose
- Avoid mixing concerns between agents
- Keep instructions actionable

### 2. Provide Context
- Include enough context for informed decisions
- Reference relevant documentation
- Show current state when applicable

### 3. Clear Instructions
- Use imperative mood ("Create", "Update", "Test")
- Be specific about expectations
- Include examples where helpful

### 4. Maintain Consistency
- Use consistent formatting across templates
- Keep variable naming consistent
- Match project documentation style

### 5. Regular Updates
- Review templates quarterly
- Update based on team feedback
- Incorporate lessons learned
- Version control template changes

## Template Debugging

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Agent not following instructions
- Check template is being loaded correctly
- Verify all variables are populated
- Look for conflicting instructions

**Problem**: Missing context
- Ensure all required variables are passed
- Check data collection in webhook handler
- Verify template path resolution

**Problem**: Poor quality outputs
- Review instruction clarity
- Add more specific examples
- Break down complex tasks

### Debug Mode

Enable template debugging:
```bash
export CLIDE_TEMPLATE_DEBUG=1
export CLIDE_SHOW_RENDERED_TEMPLATE=1
```

This will log:
- Template path resolution
- Variable substitution
- Final rendered template
- Agent response

## Version Control

Track template changes:
```bash
# Template change commit format
git commit -m "templates: improve planning agent clarity

- Add section for security considerations
- Clarify architecture decision format
- Include risk assessment checklist"
```

Consider template versioning:
```markdown
<!-- Template Version: 2.1.0 -->
<!-- Last Updated: 2024-01-15 -->
<!-- Changes: Added security section -->
```
